## TaleSpire Slab Generator

This repo is used for generating slabs for Talespire by encoding JSON data into a 64 bit string that can be processed by TaleSpire.

The current plan is to generate TaleSpire maps from Watabou Procgen Arcana's [Dungeon Generator](https://watabou.github.io/dungeon.html), which can output JSON data.
